Project 00
Collaborators: Joshua Carmen

This project pushed me to the extreme, it wasn't difficult persay, just a lot to do as one man. I have learned to truly seek out learning
more about elisp, and pushing myself to further my studies past c++ and not use it as crutch but as a guide. This project took
approximatley 6 man hours to complete.
